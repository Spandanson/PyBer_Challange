# Overview of the analysis:

* V. Isualize the senior analysist at PyBer has given us (me and Omar) a brand-new assignment.  
* Using our Python skills and knowledge of Pandas, we create a summary DataFrame of sthe ride-sharing data by city type. 
* Then, using Pandas and Matplotlib, we create a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type. 
* Finally, we submit a written report that summarizes how the data differs by city type and how those differences can be used by decision-makers at PyBer.

# Results:
  ### The final results came in Month of year V/s the Average fare($) as per the type of City I.e. Urban, Suburban and Rural.

# Summary:
### As per the results the summary comes out as below:
* The pattern for increment and decrement in the fare is almost similar every month for all types of cities.
* The average fare usually increases at the end of the month Feb and March.
* The average fare found to be less in April in comparison with the other months.
* Due to lack of data for the month of May the average value of Fares look uneven for that month but the pattern for the decrement for all types of cities are same.
